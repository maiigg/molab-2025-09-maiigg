//  OPEN THE CONSOLE TO SEE HOW MAKING AN ACCOUNT/LOGIN WORKS! make an account and sign in to see the secret





// I wanted to expand on the @APPSTORAGE example, and make an actual login page where multiple users can store their login info and new users can make new accounts, I am thinking about expanding on this for my final project, where it will be a personal portfolio where you can make your own portfolio to show off whatever work you please. For everyone to have their own personal page, logins are necessary.
//To start out, I realise the lack of security in this particular app, since you can just make a login and sign into the same page everyone else is going anyways, but to get started with the mechanics of a login page, this was a very helpful learning experience. One of the main issues I had was the navigation to another page since the user HAS to be logged in, but I looked up on the internet a different version of NavigationView, Navigation Stack. The syntax is a little different, but I was able to add a conditional statement that makes sure isLoggedIn is true so that the page can load. Overall, I can't wait to expand on this for later.
