source I used to help myself understand it a little mopre

For this homework, since I was absent last week, despite watching the zoom recording, the idea of JSON files was still very confusing, so I wanted my homework to rely on one of the JSON examples heavily so I could follow along and understand everything as I went through the code. I am glad I did this since transfering the usage from the example to my project made me go through all the code, and I had to UNDERSTAND how everything worked to know what to change. I made my own version of the example with different formats and images, and I utilised my login homework from last time to add more permission-based stuff like allowing guests in, but not letting them update. Overall, I am happy with what I learned, and hopefully I can be more independent next time when handling and coding my own code involving JSON
